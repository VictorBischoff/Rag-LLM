# Requirements for running an optimized retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG)
# system with MLX on Apple silicon.
#
# This list includes:
#  • **MLX** and **mlx‑lm** for running and loading quantized LLMs from the
#    Hugging Face *mlx‑community* repository.
#  • **LangChain**, its community extensions and integrations to build chains,
#    connect Hugging Face models, and split text into chunks.  We omit Chroma
#    here because we use FAISS as the vector store.
#  • **Sentence Transformers** for generating dense embeddings for the
#    document chunks.
#  • **PyMuPDF** (pymupdf) for loading and parsing PDF documents.  We still
#    include **pypdf** for basic PDF operations and compatibility.
#  • **FAISS** for similarity search in the RAG pipeline (replacing Chroma).
#  • **Additional utilities** for performance monitoring, caching, and error handling.
#
# Versions are pinned to specific releases as of October 3, 2025 to ensure
# compatibility with Python 3.13 and stability across installations.
